Graph Data Science,What are node embeddings?,Node embeddings compress information about a node (and its neighborhood) into a lower-dimensional vector. This enables you to compare node similarities and use them in machine learning tasks.
Graph Data Science,How does the Neo4j Graph Data Science library integrate with GenAI and LLMs?,Node embeddings and persisted similarity relationships enable you to provide more complete and explainable grounding data to LLMs in Retrieval Augmented Generation applications. 
Graph Data Science,Can I use Neo4j Graph Data Science algorithms with Python?,"Yes, the Neo4j Graph Data Science Python client provides a 'Pythonic' way to interact with Neo4j databases, run algorithms, and consume results. "
Graph Data Science,How interpretable are Neo4j graph data science algorithms?,"Graphs and graph data science algorithms often provide much more interpretability compared to other data science approaches. For example, algorithms like Degree Centrality or Node Similarity are highly explainable. "
Graph Theory,What is a graph according to graph theory?,"In data science, graphs are mathematical structures used to model relationships between entities (nodes) and the connections between them (edges). Graphs offer a powerful way to represent complex, interconnected data sets. "
Graph Theory,What is the difference between a directed and an undirected graph?," In a directed graph, edges have a defined direction (like a one-way street). An undirected graph has edges without specific directionality (like a two-way street)."
Graph Theory," In graph theory, what are the most important elements of any graph?","In graph theory, the most important elements of any graph are its vertices (the nodes or points) and its edges (the lines or connections between the vertices).  These elements form the basic structure that allows us to represent and analyze complex relationships within a system."
Graph Theory,Explain the concept of a path in a graph.,"A path in a graph is a sequence of nodes connected by edges. A simple path has no repeated nodes, while a cycle is a path where the start and end nodes are the same."
Graph Theory,What is the degree of a node in a graph?,"The degree of a node is the number of edges connected to it. In directed graphs, we distinguish between in-degree (edges pointing in) and out-degree (edges pointing out)."
Graph Theory,Define a connected graph.,"A connected graph is one where there is a path between any pair of nodes. If a graph is not connected, it consists of multiple disconnected components."
Neo4j,What kind of data model does Neo4j use?,"Neo4j uses a property graph model. Data is stored as nodes (entities), relationships (connections between nodes), and properties (key-value pairs attached to nodes and relationships)."
Neo4j,"What is Cypher, and how is it used with Neo4j?","Cypher is Neo4j's declarative query language. It uses an ASCII-art style syntax to express patterns in the graph, allowing you to create, read, update, and delete graph data."
Neo4j,Explain a use case where Neo4j would be a good fit.,"Neo4j excels in scenarios where relationships are as important as the data itself.  Examples include recommendation engines (products, content), fraud detection (linked patterns), and knowledge graphs (connecting facts)."
Neo4j,What is the concept of a label in Neo4j?,Labels are used to categorize nodes in Neo4j. A node can have multiple labels.  They help organize your data and make querying more efficient.
Neo4j,Briefly describe the concept of index-free adjacency in Neo4j.,Index-free adjacency means nodes store direct references to their neighbors. This enables extremely fast graph traversals as Neo4j doesn't need to consult external indexes to find connected nodes.
Cypher,What does the basic structure of a Cypher query look like?,"A simple Cypher query often involves:

MATCH: Pattern to find in the graph (nodes and relationships)
WHERE: Conditions to filter results
RETURN: Specifies what data to return"
Cypher,How do you represent a node in Cypher?,Nodes are represented within parentheses: (). You can add labels with a colon: (:Person).  Variable names can be assigned for later use: (p:Person).
Cypher,Explain the use of the CREATE clause in Cypher.,"The CREATE clause introduces new nodes and relationships to the graph. Example:
CREATE (p:Person {name: 'Alice', age: 30})-[:FRIEND_OF]->(b:Person {name: 'Bob'})"
Cypher,How do you match optional patterns in Cypher?,"Use OPTIONAL MATCH to include patterns that might not exist.  If the pattern isn't found, the query still proceeds, but variables related to that pattern will be null."
Cypher,"What are aggregation functions in Cypher, and give an example.",Aggregation functions perform calculations on sets of values.  Example: RETURN count(*)  counts the total number of results returned by a query.
Neo4j ,What are nodes and relationships in Neo4j?,"Nodes are the entities in a graph, storing data as properties. Relationships connect nodes, giving context and meaning to the connections."
Neo4j ,How does Neo4j store data?,"Neo4j uses a property graph model where data is stored in nodes, relationships, and their associated properties. This structure enables flexibility and efficient traversal of connected data."
Neo4j ,What are the advantages of using a graph database like Neo4j over a relational database?,"Graph databases excel at handling complex, interconnected data and revealing patterns within relationships. They offer performance advantages for queries that traverse many connections, unlike relational databases that can struggle with such joins."
Neo4j ,Can Neo4j be used for real-time applications?,"Yes, Neo4j can support real-time applications due to its efficient query performance and ability to handle rapidly changing data relationships."
Neo4j ,Is Neo4j ACID compliant?,"Yes, Neo4j supports ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring database integrity and reliability."
Neo4j ,How does Neo4j handle schema changes?,"Neo4j supports a flexible schema-optional approach, allowing you to modify the structure of your graph as your data and requirements evolve."
Neo4j ,What is the difference between properties and labels in Neo4j?,"Properties are key-value pairs that store data within nodes or relationships. Labels are used to categorize nodes, providing a way to group similar entities for easier querying."
Neo4j ,How do indexes work in Neo4j?,Neo4j can use indexes to improve query performance by allowing for fast lookups of nodes or relationships based on specific properties.
Neo4j ,Does Neo4j support different programming languages?,"Yes, Neo4j has official drivers for various programming languages like Java, Python, JavaScript, .NET, and more, enabling easy integration into your applications."
Neo4j ,Can Neo4j be deployed in the cloud?,"Yes, Neo4j offers cloud-based deployment options like Neo4j AuraDB (fully managed) and deployments on cloud marketplaces like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure."
